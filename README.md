# headbothunter
Since those hubs (LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc) are not working anymore, I decided to create an automation to help me find opportunities within companies I would love to work on. But, of course, it doesn't work if you just let someone (or something) apply for you. Therefore, "headbothunter" says: "It's up to you".
